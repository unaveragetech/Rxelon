              |
              v
           [User]
```  

---

### **Interaction Details**  

#### **Step 1: Task Submission**  
```
[User] --> (Encrypts Data + Metadata) --> [CHS]  
```
- User encrypts sensitive data with a custom key.  
- Metadata includes computational requirements like latency and resources.  

#### **Step 2: Task Assignment**  
```
[CHS] --> (Selects Optimal [Node]) --> [Node]  
```
- CHS matches task to a high-ranking node.  
- Ensures node capacity and security compliance.  

#### **Step 3: Execution**  
```
[Node] --> (Decrypts, Processes in Sandbox) --> (Encrypts Results) --> [CHS]  
```
- The node decrypts data using a CHS-sent key, executes the task, and re-encrypts the result.  

#### **Step 4: Validation and Delivery**  
```
[CHS] --> (Validates Result Hash) --> [User]  
[CHS] --> (Logs Entry to Blockchain) --> [Log]  
```
- CHS validates data integrity by comparing hashes.  
- Results are sent to the user, and the operation is logged.

### **Additional Visual Workflows for Rxelon**  

---

## **7.1. Node Lifecycle Management**  
This workflow explains how nodes are onboarded, maintained, and potentially retired from the Rxelon network.  

```
  [Node Owner] ----------------------------> [CHS]
     (Registers Node + Hardware Profile)  
                |
                v
        [Developer Verification]
     (Initial Profile Check for Validity)  
                |
                v
           [Node Activated]
      (Added to Active Node Pool)  
                |
                v
  [CHS] ----------------------------> [Node]
     (Periodic Health & Performance Metrics)
                |
     (Factors: Uptime, Task Success, Speed)  
                |
                v
  [CHS] --> (Node Ranking Updated) --> [Ledger]  
                |
                v
       [Low-Ranking Node Notification]
  (Node Fails Metrics --> Out of Rotation)
```  

### **Key Details:**  
- **Health Metrics:** Includes system performance, task response time, and uptime.  
- **Node Notifications:** Automated alerts to owners when performance metrics drop.  
- **Reactivation Process:** Owners can address issues and reapply for node rotation.  

---

## **7.2. Task Failure Recovery Workflow**  
In case a node fails during task execution, this workflow details how the Rxelon system recovers and ensures task completion.  

```
  [CHS] -----------------------------> [Node A]
     (Task Assigned to Node)  

  [Node A] --> Task Execution Starts  
                |
                v
       [Task Failure Detected]  
        (E.g., Hardware Crash)  
                |
                v
  [Node A] ---------------------------> [CHS]
    (Failure Log + Partial Data Sent)  
                |
                v
       [CHS Validates Failure]  
       (Prepares Task Reassignment)  
                |
                v
  [CHS] -----------------------------> [Node B]
       (Same Task Assigned to New Node)  
                |
                v
   [Node B] --> Task Executed Successfully  
                |
                v
  [CHS] --> Logs Failure and Recovery --> [Log]  
                |
                v
           [User Receives Results]  
```

### **Key Details:**  
- **Failure Detection:** Nodes must report errors directly to the CHS.  
- **Reassignment:** The CHS dynamically selects a new node to continue the task.  
- **Transparency:** All failures and resolutions are logged for audit purposes.

## **7.3. Secure Data Flow with Rotating Keys**  
This workflow illustrates how data security is maintained by enabling users to rotate encryption keys periodically during task execution.  

```
  [User] ----------------------------> [CHS]  
     (Task Submission + Key Rotation Enabled)  
                |
                v
   [CHS] --> (Rotating Key Generation)  
                |
                v
   [CHS] ----------------------------> [Node]
   (Sends Initial Data + First Key)  
                |
   [Node] --> Processes Initial Data Chunk  
                |
                v
  [CHS] ----------------------------> [Node]  
    (Next Data Chunk + Rotated Key Sent)  
                |
   [Node] --> Processes with New Key  
                |
                v
   [Node] ----------------------------> [CHS]  
     (Sends Processed Data Encrypted)  
                |
                v
      [CHS Validates Integrity]  
                |
                v
       [User Receives Final Output]  
```

### **Key Details:**  
- **Key Rotation:** Adds an additional layer of security by ensuring no single key is used for the entire task.  
- **Chunked Processing:** Nodes process data in smaller, secure chunks.  
- **Dynamic Key Management:** Controlled entirely by the CHS to simplify user experience.

## **7.4. Multi-Node Task Distribution Workflow**  
This workflow explains how tasks are distributed across multiple nodes for parallel processing.  

```
  [User] -----------------------------> [CHS]  
     (Submits Large Task for Parallelization)  
                |
                v
  [CHS] --> (Splits Task into Subtasks)  
                |
   [Subtask 1]       [Subtask 2]       [Subtask N]
       |                 |                  |
       v                 v                  v
   [Node A]         [Node B]          [Node N]  
    (Processes)      (Processes)       (Processes)  
                |
                v
  [CHS] <-- (Subtask Results Returned)  
                |
  [CHS] --> (Reassembles Final Result)  
                |
                v
       [User Receives Complete Output]  
```

### **Key Details:**  
- **Parallelization:** Large tasks are split into manageable chunks for faster processing.  
- **Reassembly:** The CHS combines subtasks into a coherent final result.  
- **Node Diversity:** Tasks can be assigned to geographically diverse nodes.
